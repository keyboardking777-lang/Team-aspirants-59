The Smart Traffic Signal Optimization System is a software-based solution designed to overcome the inefficiencies of fixed-time traffic signals.

Traditional traffic lights operate on predefined timing, which does not adapt to real-time traffic conditions. This often results in congestion, increased waiting time, and unnecessary fuel consumption.

Our system introduces a data-driven approach where signal timing is dynamically adjusted based on vehicle density.

Users can input the number of vehicles in each lane through a web interface. The system then calculates a priority score for each lane and allocates green signal time accordingly.

The lane with the highest traffic demand receives priority, ensuring smoother traffic flow.

Additionally, the system estimates fuel savings achieved through adaptive signal control compared to traditional fixed-time signals.

The results are visually represented using graphs, making the system intuitive and easy to analyze.

This solution demonstrates how intelligent traffic management can reduce congestion, minimize fuel wastage, and contribute to sustainable urban mobility.
